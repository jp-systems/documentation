# Project Aims
* Allow students to communicate with each other.
* Share ideas & get help with modules, assignments & general university life.
* Allow for common questions to be indexed with common answers.

# Project Scope
* TODO

# Project Risks
* Initial scope may be too large or too small, resulting in a project that is too simple and limited, or too complex and unfinished or not working properly.
* Planned application may be fundamentally too complicated to be implemented succesfully.
* Time limitations to effectively plan and implement the system.
* Incorrect initial planning of requirements & implementation, resulting in having to re-design and re-model later on in the project, resulting in delays & extra time.
* Poor communication resulting in lack of understanding between team members.
